/**
 * NEGOTIATION ENGINE — Multi-turn agent-to-agent deal-making
 *
 * When Strategist wants a loan, instead of a simple request/approve,
 * Strategist and Banker engage in multi-round negotiations:
 *
 * Round 1: Strategist proposes terms (amount, rate, duration)
 * Round 2: Banker counters with adjusted terms
 * Round 3: Strategist accepts or counters again
 * ...up to 4 rounds, then final accept/reject
 *
 * Each round uses the LLM to reason about the other agent's proposal
 * and formulate a counter-offer. This is genuine agent-to-agent negotiation.
